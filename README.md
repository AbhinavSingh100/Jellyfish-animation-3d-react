# üåä 3D Jellyfish Animation - React Three Fiber

An immersive 3D web experience featuring animated jellyfish swimming in a circular orbit around your content. This project demonstrates advanced layering techniques with React Three Fiber, creating a captivating background animation that interacts with HTML content.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual-Layer 3D Rendering**: Jellyfish appear both behind and in front of HTML content for depth
- **Smooth Orbital Animation**: Two jellyfish swim in opposite circular paths with realistic movement
- **Dynamic Visibility**: Jellyfish seamlessly transition between front and back layers based on their position
- **Realistic Lighting**: Directional lighting with shadows for enhanced visual depth
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts
- **High Performance**: Optimized 3D rendering with React Three Fiber

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Modern React with latest features
- **React Three Fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **React Three Drei** - Utility library for React Three Fiber
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **GLTF Models** - 3D jellyfish models with textures

## üéÆ How It Works

### Layered Architecture
The application uses a three-layer approach:

1. **Back Canvas**: Renders jellyfish when they're behind the HTML content (z ‚â§ 0)
2. **HTML Content**: Your main webpage content in the middle layer
3. **Front Canvas**: Renders jellyfish when they're in front of the HTML content (z > 0)

### Animation Logic
- Two jellyfish swim in circular orbits with a 20-unit radius
- They move in opposite directions (180¬∞ phase difference)
- Visibility is dynamically controlled based on their Z-position relative to the camera
- Realistic rotation aligns jellyfish with their movement direction

### 3D Rendering Features
- Orthographic camera for consistent perspective
- Directional lighting with shadow mapping
- Forest environment preset for ambient lighting
- Alpha transparency for seamless HTML integration

## üé® Customization

### Modify Animation Speed
```javascript
// In Jellyfish.jsx, adjust the speed variable
const speed = 0.5; // Lower = slower, Higher = faster
```

### Change Orbit Radius
```javascript
// In Jellyfish.jsx, modify the radius
const radius = 20; // Increase for larger orbit
```

### Update Content
Edit `Page.jsx` to customize the HTML content that appears between the jellyfish layers.

### Lighting Adjustments
Modify lighting settings in `ThreeDComp.jsx` to change the visual atmosphere.

## üì¶ Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
